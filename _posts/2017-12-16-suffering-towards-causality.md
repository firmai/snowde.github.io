**C[^1]:** 

**Linear Causality**: This effects that, no believable emperical examples of this.
**Domino Causality**: Sequential unfolding, atmospheric pressure -> wind -> turbines turn -> electricity 
**Cyclic Causality**: This effects that effects this, no believable emperical examples of this. 
**Spiraling Causality**: Involves a feedback loop towards first cause, atmospheric pressure -> wind -> atmospheric pressure -> wind -> turbines turn
**Relational Causality**: Two things work in relation to each other to cause an outcome, high pressure + low pressure -> wind -> turbines turn
**Mutual Causality**: Two things impact each other atmospheric pressure <-> wind

tl;dr: Pure causality is impossible to track. Causality is complex and is a combination of various interactions. To scientifically proclaim causality you have to localise and abstract distant casualities away by making assumptions and telling a story. 

The threshold for causality varies significantly accross disciplines.

## Defining Causality in Complex systems

Causality in complex systems is a combination of domino, cyclic, spiraling, relational and mutual causalities. 

Causal systems should give attention to Hickam's Dictum - many things, A-Y, simultaneously expalain Z. 

Good rule: donâ€™t default to Ockams Razor - the simpler the causality the more likely you are wrong. However, a simpler hypothesis makes for a more interpretable story.  

You Think, Example, Should Think, Example
Unidirectional, Bees-> Flowers -> Nectar -> Food, Bi-directional, Bees -> flowers -> Nectar -> Cross-pollinate -> flowers -> nectar -> bees. 
'Obviously' Perceptible, Heavy Object -> Sinks, Non-obvious, Dense Object -> Sinks


### The path of causality can never be complete.   

Linear and Cyclic Causality can only ever be theoretical, in a deterministic temporal world there is always a button that has to push Linear and Cyclic systems into being.

The path can never be spatially or temporally complete. There would always be something more distant and something further back leading to your reading of this piece. 

Butterfly-effect example: " The Holocaust and communism were caused by just about everything that happened in ancient Mesopotamian, including the Epic of Gilgamesh."

Understanding causal patterns become increasingly important in systems-thinking.



### Scientific/Explanatory Causality 

The world is built from systems. People understand stories.
--Alan Kay

Actual causality is too broad. Scientists have to find close causality, which is decided by the consensus in the field. Each discipline has their own little tricks to hone in on a closed system to test causality. 

Every experiment requires certain assumptions to make strong inference.

[^1]: Causality (also referred to as causation, or cause and effect) is the natural or worldly agency or efficacy that connects one process (the cause) with another process or state (the effect), where the first is partly responsible for the second, and the second is partly dependent on the first.
