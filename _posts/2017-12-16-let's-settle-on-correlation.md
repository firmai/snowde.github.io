**Extendible or Questionable Causation:**[^1]

__*Technology*__: Mobile Phones Cause Cancer, 
__*Health*__: Cold Weather Causes Colds, 

tl;dr: Causation and correltion are liquid terms. It is mostly futile to distinguish between them, let's just synonymise correlation and causation.


## An Alternative Causal Model   

**Never** conflate prediction with explanation. Predictions do not have to be backed by explanations. 

Prediction models might pick up correlated variables as inputs to a model. In fact, predictions almost always pick up correlated variables instead of causal variables.

In the comming epoch of AI, causation will take a backseat, and a new fluid definition will have to emerge. 

Researchers are obsessed with causality. The issue is that true causality can be infintely distant both spatially and temporally (butterfly effect).

A valid argument to expedite scientific research is to focus on correlation.

The upstream benefits of multiple correlations studies would allow a review study to speculate 'causation' from a correlation mapping. 

Given that explanatory causation is always abstracted and localised, a new form of 'causation' can be envisaged where the **strongest** *correlation* is deemed the causation until proven otherwise.

*The stronger the correlation, the more likely we are to hone into the actual cause by simply using correation studies.*[^3]

Imagine this hypothetical progression to what causes lung cancer following the highest observable association/correlation method:  

* People whose breath stinks are likely to get lung cancer. Effect Size 1. - 1990
* People whose salivary pH was lower than average had an increased risk for lung cancer. Effect Size 1.5 - 1992
* People whose breath stinks and cough are likely to get lung cancer. Effect Size 1.8. - 1999
* People whose salivary pH was low, coughs and breath stinks are likely to get lung cancer. Effect Size 2 - 2002
> Hmm, don't smokers cough, have low pH and have foul breath (sometimes)? 
* People who smoke are likely to get lung cancer. Effect Size 4 - 2004
* People who smoke in Beijing are likely to get lung cancer. Effect Size 5 - 2004
* People who smoke in Johannesburg are likely to get lung cancer. Effect Size 4.5 - 2004
> Hmm, race effect? 
* People who smoke in Shanghai are likely to get lung cancer. Effect Size 4.3 - 2002
> No.
* People who live next to coal plant are likely to get lung cancer. Effect Size 6 - 2004
> Hmm, smoke generally causes cancer?
* People who live next to a plant with high levels of PM2.5 are likely to get lung cancer. Effect Size 12 - 2004
* People who inhale PM2.5 are likely to get lung cancer. Effect Size 12 - 2004
* People who inhale Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) PM2.5 are likely to get lung cancer. Effect Size 15 - 2006
* People who inhale Volatile Organic Compound PM2.5 are likely to get lung cancer. Effect Size 15 - 2006
* People who inhale Formaldehyde Volatile Organic Compound PM2.5 are likely to get lung cancer. Effect Size 20 - 2006
> Hmm, very specific compounds in smoke causes cancer?
* People who inhale Formaldehyde Volatile Organic Compound PM2.5 and don't have the tumour suppressor gene, LIMD1 are likely to get lung cancer. Effect Size 24 - 2008
> Hmm, relational causality at play?


At each step, a person can infer causation although you can almost always go causally deeper and wider. 

Yes, smoking cigarettes cause cancer, wow in fact inhaling any smoke causes cancer.

Wow actually the inhalation of PM2.5 causes cancer, wow a specific type of PM2.5 causes cancer.

Wow some people seem to have a genetic proclivity in getting lung cancer while inhaling a specific type of PM2.5 Hmm there also seems to also be a relational causal relationship.

### The Threat

Causation is a threat because it leave us with a feeling of unquestionable satisfaction. 

Instead of stoping at a whiff of causation, we could have instead come to the conclusion that cigarettes can be manufactured without any harmful VOCs or more specifically PM2.5 Formaldehyde particles. 

With all this knowledge vaping[^2] could've kicked off in the 90s. 

Clearly all these things are associated with lung cancer, some more than others.  As long as you are on a *sequential* causal branch it is up to the reasearcher or scientific consensus to arbitarily clamp causality at some point.

I believe in the following distinction: causality should be clamped at the point that would be most beneficial for society as long as you are on a causal branch however, you are not sure if you are on the causal branch so just clamp the highest correlated variable.

For the above example, it currently clamped at, "smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer". However in '2002' it should have been clamped at "stop coughing, and brush your teeth with a high pH toothpaste" as there was no way to know whether you were on the causal branch.

I believe in the following distinction: causality should be clamped at the point that would be most beneficial for society if you have idnetified a sequential branch of causes. 

However in scientific circles the conduit of causality should be followed to a point of first prinicples to get to the source of generalisable knowledge (or at least to a point of technological and economical constraint) i.e. the highest correlation.[^3]
