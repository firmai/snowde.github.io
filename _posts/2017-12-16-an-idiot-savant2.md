tl;dr: Too many people claim to have some 'disorder'

## A Four-Sigma Life

**Idiot Savants** have a core skill they excel at while having below average intellect as measured by IQ.

Savant syndrome is condition in which persons with serious mental disabilities, including autistic disorder, have some 'island of genius'<sup id="fnref:1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>

I recall a period in my youth where people would claim to be dyslexic, ambidextrous and autistic to obtain the 'preceived' societal benfits of such disorders.

Looking at this correlation [trend](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=Am%20I%20Autistic,Autism%20Benefits){: target="_blank"}, it is likely that more people are claiming pseudo-syndrome status for perceived personal[benefits](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/09/autism-hidden-advantages/406180/){: target="_blank"}.

It is a shock to witness a savant. But generally speaking savants are not the best in a domain.

Savants are often seen as extraordinary due to the strong contrast of their skill against their disability. Analogy: A cat can play piano, but the cat is still not the best pianist.

People seem to mistake Savants for Genuises. Academically defined genuises (1/4)% are slightly more prevelant than savants (1/10)%. *Savants make the news and genuises everything else.*

Determining if someone is Autistic is extremely hard. **Importantly** having autism does not exclude you from being a genius, i.e. Mozart, Warhol, Dan Harmon.

`Autism ≠ Savant`

***Startups and Things***

This tendency is kreeping into silicon valley. Peter Thiel says that 'many of the more successful entrepreneurs seem to be suffering from a mild form of Asperger’s where it’s like you’re missing the imitation, socialisation gene.'

I hope for a randomised study and a standardised test in this area to test whether difficulties in social communication and interaction and a proclivity leads to more career success. And whether it can be explained sans Autism.

Since the 1990s think tanks have been trying to push the envelope with concepts such as neurodiversity, which sees autism anddyslexia as different modes of intelligence instead of pathologies that need to be cured.
