## A Six-Sigma Life   

**Idiot Savants** have a core skill they excel at while having below average intellect as measured by IQ. 

Savant syndrome is condition in which persons with serious mental disabilities, including autistic disorder, have some 'island of genius'[^3] 

I recall a period in my youth where people would claim to be dyslexic, ambidextrous and autistic to obtain the 'preceived' societal benfits of such disorders.

Looking at this<a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=Am%20I%20Dyslexic,Dyslexia%20Benefits" target="_blank">trend</a>, recall correlation is not causation, but I believe that although modern research that highlights the advantages of disorders is beneficial for allowing people with disorders to feel at ease.

many people are now also claiming pseudo-syndrome status for perceived personal benefits. 

It is a shock to you to see a savant. But generally speaking savants are not the best in a domain.

Savants are often seen as extraordinary due to the strong contrast of their skill against their disability. Analogy: A cat can play piano and it is extraordinary, but the cat is still not the best pianist.

People seem to mistake Savants for Genuises. Academically defined genuises (1/4)% are slightly more prevelant than savants (1/10)%.

Savants make news and genuises everything else. 


**_Startups and Things_**  

This tendency is kreeping into silicon valley. Peter Thiel says that 'many of the more successful entrepreneurs seem to be suffering from a mild form of Asperger’s where it’s like you’re missing the imitation, socialisation gene.'

Since teh 1990s think tanks have been trying to push the envelope with cncepts such as neurodiversity, which instead of seeing autism and
dyslexia as pathologies that need to be cured, sees them as different modes of intelligence.
