**Historical Diasporas[^1]:** American Jews: 40%-60% US Wealth/1.5% population = **33**, South African Indians: 15%-20% SA Wealth/3% population = **6**, South African Jews: 25%-30% SA Wealth/0.15% = **180**, Lebanese Brazillians: 10%-15% Brazillian Wealth/2.5% population = **5**.[^2]

The **muliplier** indicates how much more wealth a cummunity has as measured agains the population composition. In a fully egalitarian system you would expect **6** accross all groups. 

## Diaspora Success   

**Diasporas** are tricky, they have not been studied well. Likely as a result of the difficulty in getting country level wealth and population for claimed nationalities, ethnicities and religions. 

*Moreover the distinction between the beforementioned three concepts are also unclear. Ex. Shakira's dad is Lebaneses, he was borne in NY, Shakira was born in Columbia and Raised Cateholic. Is Shakira Lebanese?* 

There is a smattering of studies here and there. These studies lack emperical justication for the postulated theories.  What is made  clear is that there is some diasporas that do extremely well, the justification is left moot. The following theories seem defensible. 

1. Education:
  The majority of these nationalities emphasise education.
  
2. Status Quo:
  Diaspora communities tend to question authorities and the current way of doing things. - Historical pawns of Globalisation/Wars. 
  
3. Opression:
  Opression is another golden thread in diaspora communities. However opression without education and worldly knowledge does not seem usefull as evidenced later. 
  
3. Spiderweb:
  The wealth that enters the diaspora tends to stay inside the community as a result of bartering, favours and networks. Apart from wealth, the communities also share less tangible assets such as knowledge.  

As with all social science theories, multiple other factors could be at play. It is interesting to note that a lot of these points also relate with the economic immigrant communities of modern day such as the indians and chinese americans, who are also performing well.

There also seems to be a difference in the level of success between economic immigrants and political refugees.
