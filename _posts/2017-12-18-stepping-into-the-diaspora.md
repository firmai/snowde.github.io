**Historical Diasporas[^1]:** American Jews: 40%-60% US Wealth/1.5% population = **33**, South African Indians: 15%-20% SA Wealth/3% population = **6**, South African Jews: 25%-30% SA Wealth/0.15% = **180**, Lebanese Brazillians: 10%-15% Brazillian Wealth/2.5% population = **5**.[^2]. 

The **muliplier** indicates how much more wealth than expected based on the population composition. 

## Diaspora Success   

**Diasporas** are tricky, they have not been studied well enough. Likely as a result of the difficulty in getting country level wealth and population at the level of nationalities. 

However there is a smattering of studies here and there. What is clear is that there is some diasporas that do extremely well. 

1. Education:
  The majority of these nationalities emphasise education.
  
2. Status Quo:
  Diaspora communities tend to question authorities and the current way of doing things. - Historical pawns of Globalisation/Wars. 
  
3. Opression:
  Opression is another golden thread in diaspora communities, opression without education and worldly knowledge is not usefull.
  
3. Spiderweb:
  The wealth that enters the diaspora tends to stay inside the community as a result of bartering, favours. Aparat from weatlth, the communities also share knowledge and networks.  

As with all social science theories, multiple other factors could be at play. It is interesting to note that a lot of these points also relate with the economic immigrant communities of modern day such as the indians and chinese americans, who are also performing well.

There also seems to be a difference in the level of success between economic immigrants and political refugees.
