## Netflix Fitness Function Externality 

**Netflix** generates revenue by accumulating as many users _as possible_[^2]. I can come up with a latticework of 20 fitness functions. One example thread is. 

`f(Profit)= MonthlyRetention + MonthlyAddition`, 
`f(MonthlyRetention)= NewContent + Design`, 
`f(Design)= AlgorithmicFiltering + AutoPlay + NextWatch`
`f(AlgorithmicFiltering)= ...`

[tc;dr](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=TCDR) One profit thread is keep the customers glued! 

Apart from the single thread above, imagine a tree starting with profit and a bunch of branches/threads working there way down. The tree can be thought of as an incentive tree. 

Each branch brings back CO2/profit to the core stem. Some branches, due to deformations, require more oxegyn/costs. It is unnatural for these branches to be severed if they can instead wrap over others to obtain the necessary CO2 to 'grow as large'/'make as much profit' as they can. 

That wrapping around can be referred to as fitness externatilities. These externalities mostly transpire from happenstance. 

**_Design Externality_**  

Netflix is incentivised to generate content every month to attract users. Initially Netflix's demographic were young smart first adopters. There is content conflict between retaining this population and adding late adopters.

Due to the size of the late adopters netflix has to produce more general content. Due to the broader demographic netflix has to add more content for each sub-population to retain them. The issue is that the content can get lost without (1) intelligent filtering and (2) automatic suggestions. 

Apart from server constraints, the longer Netflix can keep a user engaged, the less likely they are to renew their cable or other subscription. This similalry has design implications such as (1) Algorithmic filtering  (2) Next Watch Options (3) Autoplay Function.

A possible externality, [we do not sleep](https://aasm.org/sleep-or-netflix-you-can-have-both-when-you-binge-watch-responsibly/)
